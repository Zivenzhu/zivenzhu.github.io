Welcome! I am an sophomore student in Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. My research is about natural language processing and graph related work, advised by Prof. [Minnan Luo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/minnluo). Meanwhile, I also love singing, dancing, rap songs and playing basketball. Currently, I am the NLP group member of the [LUD lab](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/), where I work on long document representations and other nlp application.
