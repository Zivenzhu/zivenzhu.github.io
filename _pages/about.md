Hello, everyone! I am a junior student in Xi’an Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. Previously, I did research about natural language processing and graph-related work, advised by Prof. [Minnan Luo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/minnluo). Now I am doing research about memorization capacity of deep neural networks trained on random labels, advised by Meta AI Research Scientist [Zhuang Liu](https://liuzhuang13.github.io). Currently, I am the NLP group member of the [LUD lab](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/), the foremost undergraduate research group in Xi’an Jiaotong University.
